<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Holiday Labels and Lists program (&quot;HLL&quot;)&nbsp;is meant to be used in connection with Valley&#39;s holiday programs. It streamlines the process of creating bag and gift labels, master and donor lists, participant lists, and postcard labels from VESTA reports.</p>

<p>The focus of HLL&#39;s display is the &quot;Available Label and List Files&quot; window. The items listed there are HLL&#39;s &quot;work product;&quot; its reason for being.</p>

<p>Other items in the program&#39;s window are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Controls used to select which of the available label and list files to view. You can filter the view by file type (participant list, bag labels, etc.), year, and donor, and also select whether or not to view backup files.</li>
	<li>Buttons to:
	<ul>
		<li>Process VESTA reports (that is, generate more label and list files)</li>
		<li>Delete backup files in order to free up disk space</li>
		<li>View this help file</li>
		<li>Exit the program</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>HLL does not create the VESTA reports; instead, it uses reports which have already been downloaded from VESTA. Also, HLL does not delete the VESTA reports, or change them in any way -- after you have added them, they will remain wherever you left them. You can even add them again if you want.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>Before using HLL, log in to VESTA and download one or more reports. Make sure to save them as Excel files, and remember where you save them. Then, start HLL, click &quot;Process&nbsp;VESTA Reports.&quot; A standard Windows file selection dialog will open, allowing you to go to the folder containing your VESTA reports and select those reports (either one at a time or multiple files at once).. HLL will then read the repors and use the information in them to create the appropriate label and list files.</p>

<p>Once the VESTA reports have been processed, the files generated files&nbsp;will show up in HLL under&nbsp;&quot;Available Label&nbsp;and List Files.&quot; Double-click on a file and&nbsp;it will open up in Excel or Word as appropriate, for viewing or printing.</p>

<p>When you process&nbsp;VESTA reports, if the name of an output label or list file matches a file that already exists, the older file will be renamed. For example, if &quot;Bag_Labels_2016_Clothing_Aht.docx&quot; is already there, the original will be renamed &quot;Bag_Labels_2016_Clothing_Aht.bak0001.docx,&quot; &quot;Bag_Labels_2016_Clothing_Aht.bak0002.docx,&quot; and so on. It&#39;s possible that quite a few backup files could be generated after some time -- if so desired, the backup files can be deleted.</p>

<h2>Where Are My Files?</h2>

<p>HLL puts the files it generates into subfolders under the &quot;CHRISTMAS AND HOLIDAY PROGRAMS&quot; folder on the Valley public drive. Files are sorted by year and by type. For example, for program year 2017, the files will be located as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bag and Gift Labels:&nbsp;CHRISTMAS AND HOLIDAY PROGRAMS\2017\Christmas</li>
	<li>Donor and Master Lists:&nbsp;&nbsp;CHRISTMAS AND HOLIDAY PROGRAMS\2017\Christmas</li>
	<li>Participant Lists and Postcard Labels:
	<ul>
		<li>Adopt a Family:&nbsp;&nbsp;CHRISTMAS AND HOLIDAY PROGRAMS\2017\Christmas</li>
		<li>Holiday Food Basket:&nbsp;&nbsp;CHRISTMAS AND HOLIDAY PROGRAMS\2017\Christmas</li>
		<li>Thanksgiving Basket:&nbsp;&nbsp;CHRISTMAS AND HOLIDAY PROGRAMS\2017\Thanksgiving</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Anything else (eg Fans/Heaters):&nbsp;&nbsp;CHRISTMAS AND HOLIDAY PROGRAMS\2017\Other</li>
</ul>

<p>Backup files will be placed in the same folders as the files they&#39;re backing up.</p>

<p>There is no provision in HLL to delete anything other than backup files. If you want to delete non-backup label or list files, or VESTA reports, you can do that by going to the storage folder&nbsp;via Windows Explorer and manually deleting the files.</p>

<h2>Usage Tips</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Instead of using many small VESTA reports, use a few larger ones. When you ask VESTA for the reports, you have the option of asking for reports for only a single donor and only a single report type (e.g., a Gift Label Report for Mike Albert Leasing). Instead of doing that, ask for a report for Toys and Clothing labels, both Gift and Bag, for all donors at once.&nbsp;Then tell HLL to process that one big file. It will take a while (maybe several minutes) but is a much better use of your time than processing dozens of smaller reports individually!</li>
	<li>Delete the backup files every once in a while. This may help the program run a little quicker and will also free up some disk space for other uses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problems? Suggestions? Further Questions?</h2>

<h3>I only see files for one donor!</h3>

<p>Use the Donor &quot;drop-down&quot; selecter to pick another donor. If the donor you&#39;re looking for isn&#39;t there, verify that you&#39;ve processed VESTA reports pertaining to that donor. If you&#39;re unsure about a particular VESTA report, processing that report again will do no harm.</p>

<p>(HLL does not have a &quot;display files for all donors&quot; option -- that would probably not be very comfortable to use because of the clutter.)</p>

<h3>I don&#39;t see bag/gift/donor/master files for a donor!</h3>

<p>It may be that that particular donor is not participating in that particular program.</p>

<h3>I have a suggestion for how to improve HLL, or I have another question or problem not address in this document.</h3>
